# Letter Tracing Accuracy Feature

## ✅ What Was Added

The letter tracing screen now shows **accuracy percentage** to give users feedback on how well they traced the letter!

### New Features:

#### 1. **Accuracy Calculation**
- Calculates accuracy based on drawing coverage (number of points drawn)
- Accuracy range: 60% - 100%
- More thorough tracing = higher accuracy

#### 2. **Visual Feedback Card**
Displays after each tracing attempt with:
- **Percentage score** (e.g., "85% Accurate")
- **Color-coded gradient** based on performance
- **Icon** representing achievement level
- **Encouraging message**

#### 3. **Performance Levels**

| Accuracy | Color | Icon | Message |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| 90-100% | Green | ⭐ Star | "Excellent work!" |
| 75-89% | Purple | 👍 Thumbs Up | "Great job!" |
| 60-74% | Orange | 😊 Satisfied | "Good try! Keep practicing" |
| Below 60% | Red | 🔄 Refresh | "Try again for better accuracy" |

### How It Works:

1. User traces the letter
2. When they lift their finger/mouse, accuracy is calculated
3. Animated feedback card appears showing the percentage
4. User can:
   - **Clear** to try again (resets accuracy)
   - **Next Letter** to continue (if accuracy ≥ 70%)

### Visual Design:

- **Animated card** with smooth fade-in
- **Gradient backgrounds** matching performance level
- **Large, readable percentage** display
- **Encouraging messages** for all levels
- **Responsive sizing** for all devices
